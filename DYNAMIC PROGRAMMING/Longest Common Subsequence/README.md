> Given two strings as input. Find the length of the longest common subsquence in both the strings. Subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements

- INPUT : You are given two strings, s1 and s2

- OUTPUT: Output the length of the longest common subsequence.

<hr>

> INPUT : s1 = "AGGTAB"
          s2 = "GXTXAYB"

> OUTPUT :  4

- EXPLAINATION :  
        
        Longest common subsequence is "GTAB" whose lenght is four. Therefore, the answer is 4 for this case.
