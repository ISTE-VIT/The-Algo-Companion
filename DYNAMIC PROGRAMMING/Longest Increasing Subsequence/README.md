> Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing (strictly) subsequence from the given array.
A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

- INPUT : You are provided with an array having values as integers.

- OUTPUT: Output the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

<hr>

> INPUT : arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]

> OUTPUT :  5

- EXPLAINATION :  
        
        We can see here that, longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60] whose length is 5, hence the answer is 5 for this case.
